Customer Pages
  homepage:
    in this page we will display all of the objects. We will also add a button on each object,
    which will add it to the cart. You can also click on the product picture and that will take you to the product page
  checkoutpage:
    Here we need to be able to see a table of the users cart.
    The cart should be a object that contains a user id, and a product id.
    You fetch the carts that only contain a certain user id.
